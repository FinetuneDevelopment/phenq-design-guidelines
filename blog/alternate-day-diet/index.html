          <p class="lead">Imagine a diet without any restrictions&hellip;every other day. When on a Monday you are free to eat what you like, and on a Tuesday you monitor your caloric intake. As you limit your intake on low calorie days, you will always have a high calorie day to look forward to &#150; the very next day.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h2 class="h3 col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Enjoy the foods you like&hellip; without guilt</h2>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Most diets permanently restrict the foods you can eat, which makes them much more difficult to stick to and less likely to work for you. But this is a diet that will allow you to continue to eat the foods you want and still lose weight. Here's how:</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h2 class="h3 col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Alternate-day calorie restriction</h2>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>The Alternate-Day Diet: weight loss and weight maintenance made as easy and as practical as possible. Research has shown that restricting calorie intake on alternative days increases SIRT1 gene activity in fat cells. This causes fat to move from your fat cells into the bloodstream where it is used as energy. This causes your metabolism to increase which means your body will burn more fat. This state also inhibits fat storage by switching of the PPAR-gamma gene. PPAR-gamma is responsible for storing fat in the body.</p>
          <p>Regardless of the type of food you eat on your high calorie days, when you restrict your calories on low days, a stress response is activated in the body that turns on the SIRT1, or &quot;skinny gene&#148;. The weight loss benefits of this stress response are more closely linked to the amount of calories being consumed rather than the specific foods themselves. The evidence shows that you can eat the foods you would like on high days and still lose weight.</p>
          <p>The alternate-day calorie restriction diet not only encourages your body to burn more fat, but also to store less fat. It's the ideal way for you to achieve a healthy body weight and improve your health without the stress and difficulty of complying with a traditional, restricted diet. Follow the diet and instructions in this book and you'll see results within 7-14 days.</p>

      <h2>The 3 Phases of the Alternate-Day Diet</h2>
      <p class="lead">There are three phases of the alternate-day diet you will need to follow to get the best results.</p>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Phase 1: Pre-diet detox</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Complete this stage before you begin your alternate-day calorie restriction. <a href="/phenq-design-guidelines/blog/3-day-detox-plan">This part of the diet is designed to clear your body of accumulated toxins which will otherwise hamper your weight loss efforts</a>. The pre-diet detox lasts 1-2 weeks and will maximise the weight loss you see over the next two phases of the diet.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Phase 2: Low day meal replacements</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>You will be getting all your calories on your low days from meal replacement shakes during this phase. This part of the diet is the most difficult, but only lasts two weeks. You will still be able to eat what you want to every other day, on your high calorie days. will maximise the weight loss you see over the next two phases of the diet.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Phase 3: Ongoing dieting</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>From this part of the diet your low day calories will not be so restricted, and will no longer involve meal replacement shakes. This phase is suitable for use as an ongoing diet plan and can last as long as you like.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">A note about high calorie days:</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>The goal of your high calorie days is to feel satisfied without intentionally overeating. Although you will have the freedom to eat the foods you would like on high days and still reap the benefits of the diet, it is important to remember that, for optimal health, there are foods you should eat more often, such as fruits and vegetables, and there are foods you should try to limit, like those containing trans fats.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <blockquote class="col-lg-5 quote-banner quote-banner-plain">
          <p class="h4 heading-light">It's important to enjoy eating on your high calorie days so you won't feel so deprived when you restrict your calories on low days.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Most people on the alternate-day diet find that, despite restricting their calories on low calorie days, they are no hungrier on high days than they would be if they were not on the diet, and in some cases they are less hungry. If you're not as hungry on your high days as you thought you would be, it's okay to eat less than your regular daily allowance. Don't overeat just because you can.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Phase One: Pre-Diet Detox</h2>
      <p class="lead"><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 1-2 weeks</p>
      <p class="lead">To prime your body for weight loss, you need to clear your digestive tract of all the toxins it has accumulated over the years from processed foods, toxins and other chemicals. These toxins are stored in your fat cells, causing the fat cells to expand. If you have too many toxins, your body creates new fat cells to store them in. This is why toxins are a major barrier to you losing weight. By getting rid of those toxins, you can shrink your fat cells, not to mention all the other benefits for your overall health. Getting rid of these toxins will ensure your body is in the best starting position to lose weight. You should follow the pre-diet detox for at least one week; ideally two.</p>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Benefits of the pre-diet detox:</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <ul>
            <li>Eliminate harmful toxins causing your fat cells to shrink</li>
            <li>Lose excess weight</li>
            <li>Improve your overall health and well being</li>
            <li>Strengthen your immune system</li>
            <li>Improve your energy levels</li>
            <li>Sleep better</li>
            <li>Break down emotional ties that you have with food</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">How toxins contribute to weight gain</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Much of your body fat is a result of three things; an incorrect diet, a poorly functioning liver (your major metabolism organ), and a clogged up colon. If you eat lots of processed foods, dairy, red meat, preservatives, etc you are ingesting an enormous amount of toxins. These toxins overwhelm your your liver and your colon (your two main detox organs). This happens over a long period of time, but eventually causes your liver and colon to become sluggish, slowing your metabolism and encouraging your body to store fat. For most people, this fat will be stored in the areas close to these two organs; their belly, bum, hips, and thighs.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-4"><img src="/phenq-design-guidelines/img/content/blog/3-day-detox-plan-3.jpg" alt="A woman drinks a glass of water." class="radius-medium img-fluid"></p>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">How your liver functions</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Your liver is your body's largest internal organ. It processes nutrients from your food and filters out toxins through your blood. Toxins and waste not needed by the body are carried by digestive juices called bile acids into the small intestines and out of your body. These bile acids are then re-circulated back into the small intestines and the cycle starts again. But If this re-circulated fluid is still high in fat and/or toxins, this will lead to excessive weight gain, making it almost impossible to lose weight permanently.</p>
          <p>If the liver does not regulate fat metabolism efficiently, weight gain tends to occur around the belly area. Another sign of a clogged up, slowly functioning liver can be a roll of fat around the upper abdomen. If the liver filter is blocked up with toxins and excess waste, it can't remove the small fat globules (chylomicrons) that circulate in the blood stream. These extra chylomicrons then build up in other organs and in fatty deposits under the skin which can cause cellulite in your bum, thighs, arms and belly. It can be almost impossible to lose abdominal fat until the liver function is improved.</p>
          <p>Put simply, when your liver is clogged up with junk, it will make you fat, no matter how much dieting and exercise you do. Clean out your liver and it will turn right back into the healthy, fat burning, metabolism-boosting organ it once was. And that's exactly what this pre-diet detox is designed to do.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Liver cleansing foods</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>To help clear your liver of toxins, during the next 1-2 weeks you should eat only the foods listed, although you can eat as much of these foods as you like. Try to stick to organic foods where possible and ensure you stay well hydrated by drinking at least two litres of water each day. During this detox, try and walk for at least 30 minutes to an hour every day. This is best done outside, and you should aim to break a slight sweat. You should continue to keep the foods listed in your diet even after the detox phase to help ensure your liver is functioning healthily.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Leafy green vegetables</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>One of the most important liver cleansing foods you will be eating for the next few weeks, leafy greens can be eaten raw, cooked or juiced. They are high in plant chlorophylls which help to remove environmental toxins from your bloodstream. Leafy green vegetables offer powerful protection for you liver because of their ability to neutralize heavy metals, chemicals and pesticides. They also help increase the creation and flow of bile, the substance that removes waste from the your liver and blood. Try incorporating plenty of leafy greens such as spinach, chicory, chard, watercress and lettuce into your diet.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Cruciferous Vegetables</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, kale, sprouts, bok choi and cauliflower will increase the amount of glucosinolate in your system, which aids enzyme production in the liver. These natural enzymes will help flush out carcinogens and other toxins from your body.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Cabbage</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Another cruciferous vegetable, cabbage helps stimulate crucial detoxifying enzymes that will help flush out toxins from your body. As an alternative to plain cabbage, try coleslaw, kimchi or sauerkraut.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Beets and Carrots</h3>

          <p>These are both rich in plant-flavonoids and beta-carotene, which can help stimulate and improve your liver function.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Avocados</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>This nutrient-dense food helps the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for your liver to cleanse harmful toxins. Studies have shown that those eating avocados regularly have improved liver health.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Lemons &amp; Limes</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Citrus fruits are very high in vitamin C which helps the body synthesize toxic material into substances that can be absorbed by water. Some freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice in the morning will help stimulate your liver.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Grapefruit</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Grapefruit increases the natural cleansing processes of the liver because it is high in vitamin C and antioxidants, Freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice will help boost production of liver detoxification enzymes that help flush out carcinogens and other toxins.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Apples</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>High in pectin, apples encourage the body to cleanse and release toxins from the digestive tract. This makes it easier for the liver to handle the toxic load during the cleansing process.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Garlic</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Just a small amount of garlic can activate liver enzymes that help your body flush out toxins. It is also high in allicin and selenium, two natural compounds that aid in liver cleansing.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Walnuts</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">

      <h2>Phase two: low day meal replacements</h2>
      <p class="lead"><strong>Time to complete:</strong> 2 weeks</p>
      <p class="lead">Now you've completed your detox, it's time to move onto the second phase of the diet. This is the most restrictive phase, so will also be the most difficult. However, it only lasts two weeks, which isn't very long, especially when the restriction is limited to every other day, which means a total of only seven days!</p>
      <p class="lead">On your low calorie days you will be restricted to 500 calories per day; which is about 20 percent of the total calories eaten daily by the average overweight woman.</p>
      <p class="lead">The reason for this is if you consume 20 percent of your normal calories on alternate days, you will be reducing your total calorie consumption by 40 percent a day (a total reduction of 80 percent - on the down day &#150; spread over a two-day period). This means that, on average, you'll be eating 60 percent of what you would eat normally. Eating 20 percent of what they normally would every other day is tolerable for most people.</p>

      <div class="row gutter-small">
        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Using meal replacement shakes on low calorie days</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>For the next two weeks, you will be getting your 500 low day calories specifically from meal replacement shakes. You'll be more likely to succeed with the diet when you use meal replacement shakes instead of food for the first two weeks. There are several advantages to using meal replacement shakes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shakes make it very easy for you to know exactly how many calories you are taking in, ensuring you stick to the 500 calorie allowance.</li>
            <li>Unlike regular food, you are only likely to drink your shakes when you really need to, giving you a better feeling of what it actually means to be hungry.</li>
            <li>You won't have to think about what you're going to eat next, which should help you think less about food on your low calorie days.</li>
            <li>Shakes are quick to prepare and easy to carry with you throughout the day so you can keep sipping them when you feel hungry.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Meal replacement shakes vary in protein, fat, and carbohydrate content. Those that are lowest in carbohydrates and sugar will be your best options. But the amount of sugar in the shake is less important than the total calories you consume, so find the one that tastes best for you.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>The 7 Day Diet Shake recommended above will provide you with a balanced, nutritious, high protein meal replacement for your low calorie days. It contains 20 different vitamins and minerals to ensure you are getting all your necessary nutrients while you diet. It also contains only 100 calories per serving, which means you could have up to 5 shakes per day on your low calorie days.</p>

        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Making the most of your shake</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Try to avoid drinking your entire shake all at once. Instead, drink them in small amounts and make them last. Remember, you are limited to 500 calories per day on your low days, so how many calories in your shakes will determine how many shakes you can have a day.</p>
          <p>It is up to you how you want to spread your shakes out throughout the day. Using the recommended 7 Day Diet Shake as an example, with 100 calories per serving, you could choose to have five shakes; one at breakfast, one as a mid-morning snack, another for lunch and then dinner and your final one before bed. Or you could choose to have one shake for breakfast, double up with a large 200 calorie shake for lunch to keep you going throughout the afternoon, and have your final two shakes for dinner and before bed.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Your first low calorie day will be the hardest. But after you've had your first 100-200 calories from your breakfast and mid-morning/lunch shakes, you should find that, although you may not be full, you are not starving.</p>
          <p>The real temptation is likely to come between 11 a.m. and 2.30 p.m and by late afternoon you'll undoubtedly be quite hungry and fatigued. When this happens, re-energise yourself by taking a short rest, drink plenty of water to rehydrate yourself, and have another 100 calories from your shake.</p>
          <p>The hours between dinner and bedtime are likely to be the most challenging of all because you won't be distracted by work or other daily activities. It's important to have a procedure to follow when the pressure to eat seems too great. Sit down, close your eyes and take some deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling slowly. Remind yourself why you are doing this. If it helps, visualise yourself with the new, slim body you will have at the end of the diet. Remember, you can eat the foods you want tomorrow.</p>

After three or four days, you'll notice you don't feel as hungry and your low calorie days will become easier-in fact. You should also begin seeing an improvement in your mood and energy levels. Most people find that when alternate-day dieting, they become much less aware of hunger and thoughts about food, because the mind unconsciously begins to suppress these thoughts.</p>

        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">Low calorie day strategies to stave off hunger</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Your low calorie days are only 24 hours long, and 7 to 8 of those hours will be spent sleeping. Of course, we're not suggesting you won't be hungry on your low days, so here are a few tips to help you stay strong:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>When you think you must eat, wait 20 minutes. More often than not, you'll find the craving passes. Hunger pangs occur in waves every 2 to 3 hours and typically last between 15 to 20 minutes. Remind your self that the hunger will go away if you can distract yourself for that short period of time.</li>
            <li>If you still think you're hungry, take a few sips of your shake to alleviate your hunger.</li>
            <li>Drink calorie-free liquids as much as you want on your low days to avoid becoming dehydrated. Dehydration makes you feel weak, tired, and hungry, so you'll often think you're hungry when really, you're just thirsty.</li>
            <li>Get involved in an activity you enjoy that occupies your mind and your hands. It's hard to think about two things at once, and if your hands are busy, you won't be using them to eat.</li>
            <li>Call a supportive friend or relative. Mutual support helps you to stay with the program.</li>
            <li>Sit down, close your eyes, and relax. Take some deep breaths, exhaling slowly, and rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Boost your resolve by telling yourself; &#147;I will eat tomorrow&#148;, &#147;I can always eat tomorrow&#148;, &#147;what I can't have today I'll have tomorrow&#148;</li>

        <h3 class="col-lg-5 type-gotham-medium">What about the higher calorie days?</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>On your higher calorie days:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can eat anything you want. It's important to feel you can have what you want to eat every other day to avoid the sense of deprivation</li>
            <li>The high days on this diet are your insurance that no matter what you're feeling today, you can always eat tomorrow.</li>
            <li>Keep a record of your higher calorie day's food intake after a few days just to help ensure you stay on track and don't go overboard. To give you a better idea of whether you are indulging too much; assuming you're sticking to your 500 calories on your low days, you'd have to eat a whopping 180 percent on your up days just to come out even - that's 3600 calories on average!</li>
            <li>The goal is to enjoy your food and eat until you're satisfied, but not to overeat.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="cta-box orphan radius-medium bt-mint">
            <p><strong>Nutritional note:</strong> One of the principles of this diet is that you can eat whatever you like on your high days. However, over time you'll notice that you start craving healthier foods. Once you get into the swing of eating healthier foods more often you will reap the benefits. Expect to desire all the &quot;bad&quot; foods you love like chocolate, pizza, burgers etc. less frequently as time passes.</p>

          <p>On average, you can expect to lose about 1-2 pounds per week with the alternate day diet. You may lose a little more during the first few weeks (the pre-diet detox and meal replacement phases). 1-2 pounds per week is recommended by health experts to be the safest, healthiest rate of weight loss, and is the most sustainable - meaning you are unlikely to regain this weight once you stop the diet, provided you continue eating sensibly.</p>

          <p>After your first low calorie day you should be feeling very proud of yourself for getting through it. Within just a few days you'll begin to realise that hunger is not the overwhelming force you imagined it to be. You'll start to feel proud of your ability to conquer the hunger and within a short time you'll begin to see your attitude towards food, even on your high days, changing. On your high days:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You'll begin to eat to satisfaction instead of to overeat</li>
            <li>You'll actually want to feel slightly empty rather than too full</li>
            <li>Your food preferences will also start to change - most people find they begin to choose healthier foods as a matter of course.</li>

      <h2>Phase three: ongoing dieting</h2>
      <p class="lead"><strong>Time to complete: </strong>Ongoing until you reach your goal weight By now, you should have a better sense of what it means to be hungry, and you'll have already begun to see and feel the benefits of alternate-day dieting. You'll have lost some weight and you'll be feeling more energetic. It's now time to move onto the third and final phase of the diet. You're going to stop using meal replacement shakes and get back to eating regular food every day.</p>
      <p class="lead">Depending on how much weight you want to lose, you may be able to begin to increase your calorie consumption on your lower calorie days. Be careful when allowing yourself some more freedom on your lower calorie days. It's very easy to start deceiving yourself about how many calories you are eating. If you stop losing weight, it will be because you are taking in too many calories on your lower calorie days.</p>
      <p class="lead">Count your calories on your low days to ensure you are not eating too much. If you are not already, this is also a good time to start tracking your calories on your high days. The objective is to maintain the freedom you have on the higher calorie days without falling off the rails. Keeping track of what you're eating will help keep you on track.</p>

          <p>When adjusting your calories on your low days:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The fewer calories on your lower calorie day the more weight you will lose</li>
            <li>When switching to regular food after phase two try to keep your low calorie day intake at 20 percent</li>
            <li>If you have not yet reached your goal weight yet, try and keep your low calorie days at 20 percent of what you would normally eat</li>
            <li>If 20 percent is too restrictive try 25-35 percent.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once you reach your goal weight you can increase your calorie intake to 40-50 percent. If you do this we advise you don't go over the normal amount you are supposed to eat on your higher calorie days.The main point here is to make sure you are eating between 60-75 percent of you normal food intake overall.</p>

Studies show that drinking soda increases the risk of diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, tooth decay, caffeine dependency and nutritional deficiencies. Sugar in liquid form is dangerous because so much can be consumed in so little time, sending the body into a blood sugar frenzy. When insulin levels spike, fat burning ability plummets. Consuming fizzy drinks on a daily basis can add at as much as 200 calories a day or more to your daily calorie intake. That's 1,400 calories per week.</p>

          <p>Intense or prolonged physical activity can affect your low day calorie requirements. For example, slow jogging for one mile (which takes most people about 20 minutes) burns about 100 calories, allowing you to add 100 calories to your low day intake. Just be aware that you need to be very honest with yourself about how many extra calories you are burning. Therefore, if it takes you more than 20 minutes to jog a mile or if you don't complete a full mile, make sure you adjust accordingly.</p>

You could very well see a variation in weight of as much as 3 to 4 pounds from a higher calorie day to a lower calorie day. It's a good idea to take measurements as well, to get a better idea of how your body is changing.</p>

          <p>Nuts are packed with protein, vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy, monounsaturated fat (good fats) which will help fill you up for longer. Almonds, brazil nuts and walnuts are the best type to eat for weight loss. But because they are high in calories and fat, don't eat too much. Just a small handful a day will do to fight cravings. You can introduce them into your diet by adding chopped nuts to oatmeal, cereal, yoghurt, and even to ice cream. You can also fight cravings by having some for a snack before a meal, followed by a glass of water to suppress your appetite. The water will cause the fibre in the nuts to expand in your stomach, making you feel fuller.</p>

The best, most nutritious beans are soy, pinto, garbanzo, navy, black, white, kidney, lima, red. Add beans to soups, pasta dishes, or throw some in your scrambled eggs.</p>

          <p>Protein is the basis of any solid diet plan.

Protein also helps build muscle, and the more muscle you have, the more calories your body will burn. If you are exercising regularly, you should be eating plenty of protein every day. But it must be lean meat because this has a relatively low fat content.</p>

However, research has now found that cholesterol levels do not rise as a result of eating dietary cholesterol; they rise by eating dietary fat. The protein found in eggs has the highest biological value of any other food, making it more effective for the body to use in building muscle and burning fat, so in fact, eggs should be a regular part of your diet.</p>
